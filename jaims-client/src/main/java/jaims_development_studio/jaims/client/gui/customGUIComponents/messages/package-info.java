/**
 * This package holds all classes which the client uses internally to represent
 * messages. They are used for example for sorting, storing and displaying
 * messages from the server properly because those messages don't hold enough or
 * the wrong kind of information needed by the client to run smoothly. For
 * further reading on how exactly those classes work and are used, read the
 * commentary of each class listed below:
 * 
 * <ul>
 * 
 * <li>{@link jaims_development_studio.jaims.client.gui.customGUIComponents.messages.TextMessage
 * TextMessage}</li>
 * <li>{@link jaims_development_studio.jaims.client.gui.customGUIComponents.messages.VoiceMessage
 * VoiceMessage}</li>
